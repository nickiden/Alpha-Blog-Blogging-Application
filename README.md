# Alpha-Blog
#

## Summary
This is based of the learning ruby on rails course from udemy. It is a simple blog application where users can add, edit, and create blog postings. It also introduces the concept of an admin with a simple bool function. Restraints are added so users can only edit their own blogs and profiles.

I choose to post this application to demonstrate I have a basic understanding of the Ruby on Rails and MVC frameworks. I also wanted to demonstrate the use of creating databases in Ruby on Rails. 

## Key Features

-Added Administration features so the Admin can delete or change any category, user, or blog post
-Programmed using partials so multiple views can access navigation and forms.
-Users can take advantage of gravitar so they can have a user icon
-Restrictions implemented in the controller so views can't access pages they don't have permission to
