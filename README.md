# Groovebone (alph-blog)
#

## Summary
This is based of the learning ruby on rails course from udemy. It is a simple blog application where users can add, edit, and create blog postings. It also introduces the concept of an admin with a simple bool function. Restraints are added so users can only edit their own blogs and profiles.

## What to keep
-Admin permissions so the admin can control all postings
-Alert functions
-Basic layout with nav bar

## What do change
- Get rid of search (maybe move log in to right green button)
- Create a 3rd level of permissions. Add writer to blog so only writer and admin can post
- Users create profiles and make micro posts instead?
- beef up landing page
